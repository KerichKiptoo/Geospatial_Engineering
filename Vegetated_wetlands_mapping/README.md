## Mapping Vegetated Wetlands in Kenya and Uganda using Digital Earth Africa and Machine Learning Techniques
### Purpose of the project
To map the distribution and extent of vegetated wetlands in Africa using the Digital Earth Africa platform and machine learning techniques. The goal is to provide accurate and up-to-date information on the location and condition of these important ecosystems, which provide critical ecosystem services such as water regulation and biodiversity conservation.

The project makes use of a combination of satellite imagery and machine learning techniques to identify and map vegetated wetlands. The Digital Earth Africa platform is used to access and analyze high-resolution satellite imagery, while machine learning algorithms are trained and applied to the imagery to identify and classify wetlands.

Every step in the scripts for this project is described in detail as comments and markdown. This makes it easier for anyone who wants to run the code or build upon the project to understand the process and make changes as per their needs.

A greater percentage of these codes were primarily developed by [The Digital Africa Team](https://www.digitalearthafrica.org/). However, I was also involved in the project, specifically in running the codes and modifying some parts to fit my specific needs and requirements through my expertise in geospatial data analysis and machine learning. The final results and visualization are a collaboration of the Digital Earth Africa Team and myself.
